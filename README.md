Gatsby based instagram "clone" page with Wordpress as Headless CMS.

What I could get out of this small project:
- graphql queries
- environment variable handling (deployment & production)
- passing properties from pages to components
- using createPages

deployed with Netlify: https://psychedelicdudesfakeinstapage.netlify.com/

Automatic webhooks for Wordpress based websites to trigger build on Netlify https://github.com/lukethacoder/wp-webhook-netlify-deploy
