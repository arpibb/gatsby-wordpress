Gatsby based instagram "clone" page with Wordpress as Headless CMS.

I was following the instructions of this tutorial until I realized that it is not complete, so I finished it up by myself:

What I learnt from this small project:
- graphql queries
- environment variable handling (development & production)
- passing properties from pages to components
- using createPages
- deploying to netlify
- webhooks 

deployed with Netlify: https://psychedelicdudesfakeinstapage.netlify.com/
